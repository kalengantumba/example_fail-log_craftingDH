Geeting started I completed Creating this fail log was abit confusing. I found that I had to go back and forth to ensure that I was following the rights steps in geting started. 
Despite this difficulty, As being my first time taking a techonlogy course, I really enjoyed getting to learn about the proceess invovled  when it comes to creating annotes. 
Alot of times on the media everything that is despicted is all perfect and good. However I am learning through this course about the tons of work that goes on behind the scenes is really eye opening. Thus it requires alot of patience.

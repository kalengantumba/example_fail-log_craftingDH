# Week 1 fail log
 This week I was able to create my GitHub, DH Box, and Hypothesis accounts. I discovered the signing up to be bit more easier and quicker.
## First Annotation
 I basicaly followed the Instuction on the highlight part " THIS TEXT" and made a comment. I also found the instruction vidoes really helpful so that was a bonus !

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, this week went well. I think for a first task it helped me be informed about what the other excersises will contain, and I am looking forward to learn more and be tech savvy !
